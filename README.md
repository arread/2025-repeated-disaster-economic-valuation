## Notes
I am publishing this code as-is for the moment (July 2025), meaning that there are places where the code could be refined and commented out more robustly. I will go back through and add comments and reformat some things for clarity at a later date; however, I will not be making any revisions to this code to improve efficiency--the point of this repository is to show what I *did* to produce the paper. Cleaner, more efficient versions of the code will be published under a different repository in the future as part of work I'm doing to extend and add to the analyses in this paper (for other projects).

Please also note that this code was originally run in January 2023; package updates (especially to the `did` package) may impact performance when trying to run this code in 2025 or after. For a true replication, use a late 2022 version of the `did` package; for new projects inspired by this one, I recommend using the most up to date packages and making adjustments to the code as necessary, because newer versions of the `did` package make these models much less computationally intensive to run.

### Tornado data

These are available from [NOAA/NWS Storm Prediction Center SVRGIS](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/gis/svrgis/). You can either go to the website and download the most recent tornado paths dataset, or use the code in the `Importing.R` script to automatically fetch the data.

## Tools
The vast majority of this analysis was done in R/R Studio. One part of the analysis (imputation) was done in STATA. Although I would prefer to rewrite the code to do the imputation in R as well, I will leave that for future projects. The purpose of publishing this code is to show what I actually did to produce the paper, which in this case included using STATA for a portion of the analysis. The .do file is included in the Scripts folder.

## Scripts
Run scripts in this order:

1. `Importing.R` - Ingests the data from the social explorer tables and the SVRGIS tornado paths, and imposes highest level data filters (selected variables; range of years; minimum tornado magnitude)
2. `Cleaning.R` - Generates the merged dataset and cleans/restricts/calculates variables used
3. `Imputation.do` - (run in STATA) imputes missing values due to geography shifts in 1970-1980
4. `Matching.R` - Obtains the matched control sample used in analysis
6. `Trimming.R` - Generates the final data frame for analysis
5. `Analysis.R` - Runs the difference-in-difference models used in analysis
6. `Tables.R` - Generates the descriptive/summary tables used in the paper
